If any hardware issues are detected, recommend contacting the manufacturer or authorized service centers for possible repairs or replacements under warranty. Additionally, suggest using factory reset as a last resort, being aware that it will erase all user data, so backups are crucial. If problems persist even after these steps, it may indicate a broader design or manufacturing issue that requires further investigation by the product development team.\n",

            "2. **Improve Night Mode for Zoom Features**: Although Night Mode is impressive, it could be optimized for digital zoom. Currently, enabling zoom in Night Mode significantly compromises image quality. Enhancing the algorithm to maintain quality at higher zoom levels would be a valuable addition.\n",

            "3. **Incorporate AI-Driven Scene Recognition**: Introduce an AI-powered scene recognition feature that automatically adjusts camera settings (like ISO, shutter speed, and white balance) based on the subject and lighting conditions. This would further enhance low-light performance and ensure optimal settings are consistently applied for various scenarios, making the camera even more user-friendly and efficient.\n",
